## Resources

* [HTML5 Outliner](https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/) - this is the source I used to read my page in an outline form. I used this resource to go back into my code and do a little restructuring to make sure it would make sense to screenreaders.
* [Visually Hidden CSS](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css) - I used this allowed boilerplate CSS from GitHub to hide headings in my code used for screenreading purposes only.

## Comments

This was a fun yet challenging project for me. The most challenging part of this long process was going at a slow, steady pace as I rearranged the code and restyled the page. I would get ahead of myself very quickly then go to check the page and something would usually be off. If I didn't go line by line, I became unorganized and my commits would be too full. I wanted to work on having very specific commits in this project to help with version control in the long run, and I found that to be a much more difficult and disciplined skill than I expected. It will take some time and practice, but I want to be more skilled with using commits and git to its full potential. And I believe to do so, I need to practice committing frequently and work on my messages. In a previous assignment, I was given helpful feedback that my messages shouldn't answer how but instead answer why. I focused on this type of commit messaging for the project, and I would love to hear if that showed or if my messages need more work. Again, my biggest hinderance in this assignment was doing too much for each commit, but I looking back at my log, I can now see how having more commits can only help when coming back to a project in the future. I will do a better job of this as I continue building my skills in git.
